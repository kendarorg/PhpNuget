# PhpNuget V. 4.1.0.0

## Purpose

This is born to have my personal repository for nuget, on my cheapo PHP hosting.
With support for complex OData queries.

Verified on:

* PHP 5.3.17-IIS 7
* PHP 5.3.21-IIS 7
* PHP 5.5.8-Apache 2.0 (Windows 8 Pro)
* PHP 5.6-IIS 8
* PHP 5.4.2-Apache 2.0 (OpenSuse 13.1)
* PHP 5.3.3-Apache 2.2 (CentOS 6.5)
* PHP 7.0.14-Apache 2.4 (Windows 10 Home)
* PHP 7.3.5-Apache 2.4 (Windows 7 Pro)

## Installation

### Notes for everybody

* When installing the MySql version the db must be present with the user configured!
* The module php_curl must be present and configured inside the php.ini
* The max size for uploads and post should be set on php.ini, with according values. I usually set the following values
    * post_max_size=20M
    * upload_max_filesize=20M

### Notes for Apache With Red Hat Linux

On Red Hat Linux the mod_rewrite must be enabled on the application directory
since most features depends on it. This can be achieved modifying

	/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf

Then on the definition of the phpnuget directory, change the AllowOverride from "None"
to "All"

From:


	<Directory "/var/www/html/phpnugetdir">
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride None
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

To:

	<Directory "/var/www/html/phpnugetdir">
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

And then restart Apache

	sudo service httpd restart

This should be enough to let everything works

### Notes for Apache on Windows

If php is unable to load curl-related functions copy the following files from the php directory to "C:\Windows\System".
You can verify this by downloading a file from the official nuget repository via the manage packages page.

* libeay32.dll
* libsasl.dll
* ssleay32.dll
* libssh2

### Prerequisites For IIS

These steps are NOT needed if your hosting already configured PHP

* Create the website with a standard web.config
* Install PHP for IIS (see at the end of this document 'Installation of PHP for IIS')
* Mark the location of *php-cgi.exe*

### Common

* Download from [Kendar.org](http://www.kendar.org/?p=/dotnet/phpnuget)
* Extract somewhere
* Copy the content of the directory "src" in the location you choose for the server. *DO NOT COPY THE WEB.CONFIG IF IN IIS*
* Enable write/read/delete access on
	* db: Directory where all databases and packages are stored
	* settings.php
	* Web.Config
	* .htaccess
* Verify to have write permissions on the "db" directory.
* Eventually set the environment variables for custom data directories. This will override the setting in the setup page
    * UPLOAD_DIR: Where the files will be uploaded
    * DATA_DIR: For txt based version where the plain text db files will be saved
* Open the setup page at http://myhost/mynuget/setup.php and follow the wizard. The value will be prefilled
	* Admin UserId: the user that will be created (or updated) as admin
	* Admin Password: the password (on update will be overwritten)
	* Admin Email: ...
	* Password Regex: The regex that will be used to verify the password (default min 8 chars, max 40)
	* Password Description: The error to show when the password is not matching the regex
	* Application path: If the website is "http://host/nuget" will be "nuget". If the website is "http://host" will be empty.
	* Data Root: The directory in which the txt db will be placed. It's usually a subdir of the website but can be changed.
	* Packages Root: The directory in which the uploaded packages will be placed. It's usually a subdir of the website but can be changed.
	* php-cgi.exe: To allow the configuration of php under IIS.
	* Allow GRAVATAR usage: Allow the search for gravatar icon to be shown on users.
	* Allow package update via Upload: Default disabled, if enabled it is possible to overwrite the packages BUT THIS IS NOT A STANDARD BEHAVIOUR.
	* Allow package delete: Default disabled. LEAVING IT ENABLED IS NOT A STANDARD BEHAVIOUR
* When using the mysql installation
	* Check the "Use mysql" and fill the configuration data
	* NOTE: Import from txt db does not yet work!!!
* If under IIS set the path of 'php-cgi.exe' (leave blank if your hosting already configured PHP)
* Change the password, email and login of the administration without worries.
* Rename the setup.php to setup.bak FOR SECURITY REASONS
* Remove write access on
	* settings.php
	* Web.Config
	* .htaccess
* Now open http://myhost/mynuget and see the gallery
* Happy Nugetting!

## Daily usage

* Configure your Visual Studio or Chocolatey to use http://myhost/mynuget/api/v2/ as repository
* To upload packages through command line:

#### Simple package

	nuget push mypackage.nupkg myApiKey http://myhost/mynuget/upload


#### Symbol package without packageType in nuspec

Specifying a different API (the url must be registered through the API key).


	nuget push mypackage.nupkg myApiKey http://myhost/mynuget/uploadsymbol


#### Symbol package with packageType in nuspec

Can be used the standard command, adding inside the nuspec the following part

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2013/05/nuspec.xsd">
      <metadata>
        ...
        <packageTypes>
          <packageType name="SymbolsPackage" />
        </packageTypes>
        ...
      </metadata>
    </package>


* To search items the syntax follow the OData specification (more or less). Some example
	* Id eq \'NUnit\': Search for all packages with id equals to NUnit
	* substringof(\'Microsoft\',Author): Search for all packages with Microsoft between the authors
	* Version gt \'1.0.1.0.beta\': Search for all packages with version greater than 1.0.1.0.beta
* All search blocks can be grouped with parenthesis and with 'and' and 'or' keywords.
* The keywords are
	* gt/gte: Greater/Greater equal
	* lt/lte: Lower/Lower equal
	* eq/neq: Equal/Not Equals
	* substringof: Check if the first parameter is contained in the second parameter

## Administration

Note that the symbol packages are visible only through the "Packages" UI function.
Deleting a package will  result in deleting its associated symbols.

### Simple user

* Must be registered to upload/modify packages
* Can only edit the packages that he uploaded
* When an user upload for the first time a package with a certain id, then all versions will be owned by the same user. No other users but the administrators could modify or upload packages with the same id.
* The token available to access the API for the upload can be regenerated by any user.
* The API token can be used with our without the curly braces.
* The users will see in their list of packages only the packages that they uploaded.

### For the administrators

* They can add/remove/enable users
* They can add/modify any package. When a package uploaded initially by another user is uploaded by the administrator, the ownership of the package will be kept the same.
* It is possible to download packages from external sources. It will be sufficent to insert the address from which the packages would be taken, specifying where should be put the identifier and the version of the package to download locally (through the @ID and @VERSION tags)
* When the database is corrupted it can be regenerated through "Refresh packages db from packages directory." mind that all the packages will become owned by the administrators.
* It would be possible to upload the packages directly on the 'db/packages' directory and then run the "Refresh packages db from packages directory.". All packages not yet present on the database will be loaded.

## The Api

The nuget API is based more or less on the OData protocol.
All of the api lsited that returns a collection support the usage of parameters

## Installation of PHP for IIS

### Installation for IIS 8

Tested on Windows 8 pro X64 bit and Windows 8.1 pro X64

This guid is adapted from [iis.net](http://www.iis.net/learn/application-frameworks/install-and-configure-php-on-iis/using-php-manager-for-iis-to-setup-and-configure-php)

1. download [php for windows](http://windows.php.net/)
2. extract downloaded zip ( C:/php )
3. download [php manager[(http://phpmanager.codeplex.com/releases) for IIS ( its an extension  for managing PHP from IIS control panel )
4. open php manager and click on register new php installation
5. choose php-cgi.exe and click ok (usually is inside 'C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\v5.3\php-cgi.exe')
6. now check phpinfo and choose error reporting
7. open your favorite code editor and type

<?php echo "Hello World !" ; ?>

and save this as hello.php ( or anything ) on c:inetpubwwwroot
and open http://localhost/hello.php

now IIS is serving PHP now in next tutorial i will show you how to set up MySQL in windows

### Features of PHP manger

* Register PHP with IIS
* Validate and properly configure existing PHP installations
* Run multiple PHP versions side by side on the same server and even within the same web site
* Check PHP runtime configuration and environment (output of phpinfo() function)
* Configure various PHP settings
* Enable or disable PHP extensions
* Remotely manage PHP configuration in php.ini file.
* Easily install, configure, manage and troubleshoot one or many PHP versions on the same IIS server.
* Get updated packages
* Support viewing the profile in gallery, "nuget like" https://www.nuget.org/profiles/kendar.org
* Delete packages (when configured)

## Docker

You can run the docker file with all data. Build

	docker build -t phpnuget .

And run

	docker run --detach \
		--name phpnuget \
		--publish 80:80 \
		--publish 443:443 \
		--publish 9003:9003 \
		--restart unless-stopped \
		--volume src:/htdocs \
		--env ROOT_PWD="root" \
		phpnuget:latest

Or when settings the address

	docker run --detach \
		--name phpnuget \
		--hostname phpnuget.local \
		--env HTTP_SERVER_NAME="www.phpnuget.xyz" \
		--env HTTPS_SERVER_NAME="www.phpnuget.xyz" \
		--env SERVER_ADMIN="admin@phpnuget.xyz" \
		--env TZ="Europe/Paris" \
		--env PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT="512M" \
		--publish 80:80 \
		--publish 443:443 \
		--publish 9003:9003 \
		--restart unless-stopped \
		--volume src:/htdocs \
		--env ROOT_PWD="root" \
		phpnuget:latest

Then you can go on the following address and start nugetting!

	http://dockeraddress:80
